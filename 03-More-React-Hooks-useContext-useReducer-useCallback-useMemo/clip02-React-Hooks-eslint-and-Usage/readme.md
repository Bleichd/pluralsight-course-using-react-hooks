# readme

This project is the simplest NextJS app you can create. As is shown in the associated clip, it simply adds to the base project created
in the previous module, second clip,

/pluralsight-course-using-react-hooks/02-Basic-React-Hooks-useState-useRef-useEffect/clip2-Setting-Up-Toolchain

All that is added is the file ``.eslintrc.json` and dev dependencies in `package.json` as follows:

```
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint": "^7.22.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.23.1",
    "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^4.2.0",
    "prettier": "2.2.1"
  }
```

The next clip in this module is a different code base so you don't need to carry these files forward. The eslint setup is carried
forward as you can see in all the package.json files for the rest of the course.
